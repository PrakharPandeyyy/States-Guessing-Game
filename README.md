State Guessing Game in Python
This is a simple implementation of a State Guessing Game using Python.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run the program, you'll need Python 3 installed on your system.

How to Play
The objective of the game is to guess the name of a US state based on its capital city or its abbreviation. The program will randomly select a state and display its capital city and abbreviation. You can then guess the name of the state by typing it in. The program will tell you if you're correct or not.

You can also play in reverse mode, where the program will show you a state and ask you to guess its capital city or abbreviation.

The game will keep track of your score and display it at the end of each round.
